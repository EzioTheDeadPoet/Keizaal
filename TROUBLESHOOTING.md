### "*Wabbajack throws an error after authorizing through Nexus.*"

Download the [.Net Framework 4.8 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085155). Be sure to restart your computer afterward.

### "*Wabbajack is stuck during installation.*"

Simply restart Wabbajack, you will not lose progress on your downloads.

### "*A mod fails to download.*"

If Wabbajack fails to download a mod, try downloading it manually. Place the manually downloaded mod in your downloads folder where the other Wabbajack downloads are in your Mod Organizer. Do not extract them. Note that some of these are big files and may take a while.

### "*ModOrganizer.exe throws and error when trying to launch.*"

Download the newest [Visual C++ 2019 redists](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). Be sure to restart your computer afterward.

### "*Skyrim is capped at 72 FPS.*"

The mod Movement Behavior Overhaul will cause animations to break if the framerate goes over 75 FPS, so I've capped the FPS to 72 in order to prevent that.

### "*Savegames aren't in My Games.*"

I have moved Skyrim's savegames from their default location to "/Mod Organizer 2/profiles/Keizaal/saves" in order to better protect them in the case that the Skyrim Shredder needs to be run.

### "*Tweaks made with BethINI aren't correctly changing the settings in-game.*"

BethINI can handle the majority of tweaks that you would generally want to make. However, some of the more niche settings may be handled by .inis that BethINI can't edit. These will need to be edited manually.

In order to manually edit the .inis you will first need to find the "Keizaal Settings" mod in the left pane of Mod Organizer. It should be near the bottom. Once you find it, right click on it and select "Information".

Once you have done that a window should pop up. Once that window appears select the ".ini Files" tab at the top.

You should now see a list of all the .ini files present in Keizaal. You can edit and save these settings from this interface.

Some configuration settings may be stored in a non-.ini format. If that is the case you can edit them through the "Text Files" tab.

Please note that manual installations are **NOT SUPPORTED**. There are simply too many variables that go on during manual installations that attempting to troubleshoot each user individually is simply not realistic, it would likely be a waste of everyone's time.
